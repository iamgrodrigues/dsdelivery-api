It's important to mention that this is one of the applications from the DsDelivery System

In order to explore the others, feel free to click on the link below:

* [DsDelivery WEB](https://github.com/iamgrodrigues/dsdelivery-web)


# Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Docker to run PostgreSQL image](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [PostgreSQL installed locally](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

# :construction_worker: Installation

To install this application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamgrodrigues/dsdelivery-api.git
```

If you have a SSH key registered in your Github account, clone the project using this command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:iamgrodrigues/dsdelivery-api.git
```

# :runner: Getting Started

## Running the Application Locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.iamgrodrigues.dsdeliveryapi.DsDeliveryApiApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
After the above command, you can navigate to the following address to see the project up and runnig:

```shell
http://localhost:8080/orders
```

## Running Docker Container
> Note: Skip this part if you have PostgreSQL installed

Once you've installed Docker, run the following command: that will start up the PostgreSQL container on 5432:5432 port, set up enviroment variables for user and password, and create a database called dsdelivery.

```bash
docker run --name dsdelivery-db -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1234567 -e POSTGRES_DB=dsdelivery postgres
```

## Create Tables and Populate the Database
> Note: If you already have PostgreSQL installed on your machine, skip the docker related commands. 

Run the following command to get inside of the docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --net=host postgres /bin/bash
```

Change the active profile on the `application.properties` file to `dev`, uncomment the first four lines on the `application-dev.properties` file, and then restart the application. Once the application is up, a `create.sql` file will be created on the root project folder. Copy its contents, and paste it after the following command.

```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres dsdelivery
```
In order to populate the database, you must copy the contents of the `data.sql` file and paste it after the above command.

## Status Codes

DsDelivery returns the following status codes in its API:

| Status Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 200 | `OK` |
| 201 | `CREATED` |
| 400 | `BAD REQUEST` |
| 500 | `INTERNAL SERVER ERROR` |

> Error handling will be added soon.
